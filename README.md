drush-cron-backup
=================

Script to help you backup your Drupal based website, using the command line helper and wonder Drush


Basically it's a copy if [Sam Hobb's script](https://samhobbs.co.uk/2014/06/backup-script-drupal-using-drush-and-cron), expecting to save it from being lost and maybe get a little bit of evolution, so I'm not taking any credit.

I have been using the script and works great, so kudos to Sam!
